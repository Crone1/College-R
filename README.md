# R
This repository contains all of my code for the college module 'Programming For Data Analytics'. This module focused on the programming language R where we learned the fundamentals of programming in R and explored modelling and visualising data in R.

The folders in this repository breakdown as follows:

- The *'Changing Data Formats'* folder looks at data manipulation and reformatting using a student results dataset.

- The *'Classify hand written numbers'* and *'Modelling hand written numbers'* folders contain code used to classify and model data in the popular MNIST hand-written numbers dataset.

- The *'Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors'*,  *'Plotting handwritten numbers'*, *'Rotating squares, cubes & their projections'* and *'Rotating cubes with point clouds'* folders then focus on extracting the information from the data and visualising it to create insightful plots. Again the MNIST hand-written numbers dataset was used for this. These hand-written numbers were plotted as a point cloud in different forms.
