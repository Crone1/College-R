# Overview
This repository contains R code relating to projects I completed during my time learning the programming language *R*.
These projects focused on the fundamentals of programming for data analytics using R.

The files in this repo are grouped based on the respective project they related to.
Each project follows the progressive introduction and development of R concepts and how they can be used to solve data anlytics problems.

### [Analysing Student Grades](01__Analysing_Student_Grades)
This project focused analysing the resulting grades of a group of students across a number of different subjects.
The key concepts covered here were:
- Manipulating and reformatting data
- Plotting data

### [Visualising Random Normal Vectors](02__Visualising_Random_Normal_Vectors)
This project focused on effectively visualising generated datapoints in a point cloud.
The key concepts covered here were:
- Generating random data
- Visualisating data using its EigenVectors

### [Visualising Rotating Shapes](03__Visualising_Rotating_Shapes)
This project focused on visualising data in a way that is easy to interpret and extract information from.
The key concepts covered here were:
- Looping over data
- Rotating plotted data
- Creating data projections 

### [Modelling MNIST Handwritten Numbers](04__Modelling_MNIST_Handwritten_Numbers)
This project focused on visualising and modelling the MNIST dataset.
This dataset contains images of handwritten numbers ranging from `0` to `9`.
These images can be read in as matrices which can be plotted as a point cloud and then used for modelling tasks.
The key concepts covered here were:
- Visualising images
- Modelling data for classification
- Modelling data for generation
